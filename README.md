## Overview
### Description
When you’re bored or have nothing to do, download the Time Killer App! A productivity app that  will suggest potential activities to get organized, improve habits and increase focus. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity, Hobbies, Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile since it is more convenient to bring it up on your phone than the web.
- **Story:** Recommends activities based off of users interests. Mostly at home activities. 
- **Market:** Any individual of any age group could choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** An app to help you develop better habits - set your targets for the things you want to spend more time doing and just open our app. Rather than telling  you things you shouldn’t be doing TimeKiller puts focus on what you could be doing better!
- **Scope:** First we would start with giving people suggestions for things that they can generally do; in the long run it can be something where the app is able to “Smart” suggest ideas based on the users likes and dislikes.
